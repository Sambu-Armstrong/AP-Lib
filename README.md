Description of the system

    This is a Library system mimicking some functions that occur in  a library.

        1.The Lib_Item class is a general class of items in a library like CD's for audio books, physical books , exam papers e.t.c.

        2.The Book class extends the Lib_Item class where the book can be borrowed and returned. If the book is borrowed then it is currently not available

        3.The Member class represents some actions that a member can perform  such as borrowing and returning a book

        4.The Library class shows the library as a whole enabling you to add new members and books. it can also lend the books to the members

        5. The libraryGUI contains a Graphical User Interface for the system prompting user to input data 


N/B: For the GUI I am using TKinter . If it is not installed used this to install:  pip install tk
